HashViewer
==========

A simple cryptographic hash viewer written in C#/Gtk#
-----------------------------------------------------

Not really much to say about it. I recently went back to linux
and was working on this tool for Windows, so I thought I'd bring it
over. The idea was simply to be able to right click on a file in 
my file manager and get a window showing me the hashes of the file.
